## Images
*Controlling the size and alignment of 
your images using CSS keeps rules that 
affect the presentation of your page in 
the CSS and out of the HTML markup*

**Aligning img**
- the float property can be used 
to move an element to the left or 
the right of its containing block, 
allowing text to flow around it.

- The background-image
property allows you to place 
an image behind any HTML 
element.
  1.repeat-x
The image is repeated 
horizontally
2.repeat-y
The image is repeated vertically 
only
3.fixed
The background image stays in 
the same position on the page.
4.scroll
The background image moves 
up and down as the user scrolls 
up and down the page
- shorthand background
the background property acts 
like a shorthand for all of the 
other background properties 
you have just seen, and also the 
background-color property
  1: background-color
  2: background-image
  3: background-repeat
  4: background-attachment
  5: background-position
- Contrast of background images
  If you want to overlay text on a background image, the image must be low 
contrast in order for the text to be legible.

## Practical Information
SEO is a huge topic and several books have been written on the subject. 
The following pages will help you understand the key concepts so you can 
improve your website's visibility on search engines.

**In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords**
![img](https://cdn.nichehacks.com/assets/images/find-keywords-for-website-1.png?mtime=20200617123506&focal=none)
- Page Title
The page title appears at the top 
of the browser window or on the 
tab of a browser
- URL / Web Address
The name of the file is part of 
the URL.
- Headings
If the keywords are in a heading 
< hn> element then a search 
engine will know that this page is 
all about that subject
- Text
Where possible, it helps to 
repeat the keywords in the main 
body of the text at least 2-3 
times
- Link Text
Use keywords in the text that 
create links between pages
- Image Alt Text
Search engines rely on you 
providing accurate descriptions 
of images in the alt text.
- Page Descriptions
The description also lives inside 
the <head> element and is 
specified using a <meta> tag


**Determining which keywords to use on your site can be one of the 
hardest tasks when you start to think about SEO. Here are six steps that 
will help you identify the right keywords and phrases for your site.**
- Brainstorm

*As soon as people start coming to your site, you can start analyzing 
how they found it, what they were looking at and at what point they are 
leaving. One of the best tools for doing this is a free service offered by 
Google called Google Analytics.*
