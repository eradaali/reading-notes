## Layout
- Building Blocks
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
   -  Block-level elements start on a new line
   - Inline elements flow in between surrounding text.



To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use 
box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed. (You will meet these when we introduce the positioning schemes.

CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control 
the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute 
positioning. 
1- Normal flow
2- Relative Positioning
3- bsolute positioning

- Page Sizes

designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide 
(since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).

- Screen Resolution*

Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch.

- **Screen size***:

Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information.
 - *Screen Resolution* Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch.
 - *Page Sizes*:Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide .
 - *Liquid layout* designs stretch and contract as the user increases 
or decreases the size of their browser window.

#### Fixed Width **Layouts**

- Advantages
1. Pixel values are accurate at controlling size and positioning of elements.
2.  You can control the lengths of lines of text regardless of the size of the user's window.
1. Pixel values are accurate at controlling size and positioning of elements.

3.  The designer has far greater control over the appearance 
and position of items .



- Disadvantages
1.  You can end up with big gaps around the edge of a page.
2.  The design works best on devices that have a site or 
resolution similar to that of desktop or laptop computers.

3. f the user's screen is a much higher resolution than the designer's screen, the page 
can look smaller and text can be harder to read.

### CSS Frameworks
CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for 
common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating 
printer-friendly versions of pages and so on.

**Liquid Layouts**
Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases 
or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to 
use percentages


- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

- <div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.

- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
